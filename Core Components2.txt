3. Extending the Core Components:

Combine two or more Core Components for a new Component.
For this purpose, we will use the List component of the Core Component Library.
Eg:Create the speaker pages and adding to the ancestry home page.

Open the created home page.
Drag-and-drop a List-component.
Open the dialog.
As Build List Using select Fixed list.
As Options for Fixed List add the following pages:
Eg:
/conten/speaker/satya-nadella
/content/speaker/shantanu-narayen
Save the dialog.

Create an overlay of the List item HTL-Template to customize the HTML output
Go to CRXDE Lite and browse to the List component of the Core Component at /apps/core/wcm/components/list/v2/list.
Then Copy the item.html file and paste the file inside the apps folder at /apps/ancestry/components/content/list.

4. Create a client-side library folder for the list component with the category ancestry.site and put the files speaker.js and speaker.less in this folder. Proceed as follows:

Select the /apps/ancestry/components/content/list 
Right-Click > Create Node
Provide a Name - clientlib-speaker
Select the Type - cq:ClientLibraryFolder
Click OK to confirm. Click Save All
Click on the clientlibs folder and add the following multi-value property:
Name : categories
Type : String
Value : Note : Keep blank for now
Multi : Press on Multi button
Click OK. Save the changes.

5. Extending the edit dialog:

Sometimes it's also necessary to extend the existing  dialog of a core component.
In this exercise we will extend the dialog of the list component so that authors can control if the subtitle of a speaker should be displayed or not in the list.
Browse to the existing dilalog of the list component in CRXDE Lite at the path /apps/core/wcm/components/list/v2/list/cq:dialog.
Copy the node by opening the context dialog in CRXDE Lite 
Paste the copied node at path : /apps/ancestry/components/content/list.

Expand the node structure of the dialog up to the tab level.

Delete the listSettings node and rename the itemSettings node to speakerSettings. 
Change the jcr:title property of that node in speakerSettings to Speaker Settings
Under the speakerSettings node rename the linkItems subnode to showSubtile and remove all the other nodes at the same level.
Edit the properties of the showSubtitle node with the following values:

fieldDescription	String	Show subtitle of the Speaker
name	String	./showSubtitle
sling:resourceType	String	granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/checkbox
text	String	Show subtitle
uncheckedValue	String	false
value	String	true

Save the changes by clicking on the Save All menu item in upper left of CRXDE Lite.

With the help of the Resource Merger feature the new node structure is getting merged with the existing dialog of the list component.

Change the item.html template from the former exercise in CRXDE Lite at the path /apps/ancestry/components/content/list/item.html and 
add a data-sly-test condition to the subtitle section. 
<span data-sly-test="${properties.showSubtitle}" class="speaker__item-subtitle">${item.subTitle}</span>

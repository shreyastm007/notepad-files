1. Using the Core Components:

In this exercise we will create the FAQ page and add a title and a text component.
Adding a carousel component

Go to AEM > Sites.
Create a page in ancestry with the title: FAQ.
Open the page.
Add a title component and set the title to: Have a question?.
Add a text component and set the text to: Find answers to what you want to know about the conference..
Add a tabs component to the page.
As an accordion component is not yet available as a Core Component, we will use the tabs component to display the content.
Open the tabs dialog:
Set the title of the first tab to: Pricing information.
Set the title of the second tab to: Registration information.
Save the dialog.
Drag-and-drop a text component to the first tab.

Edit the text component and copy-and-paste the content below:
What is the registration fee for Summit?
Are there any discounts for groups?

Select the tabs component. In the toolbar click the Select Panel action and select the second tab from the popover.
Drag-and-drop a text component to the second tab and copy-and-paste the content below:
What are the registration policies/terms and conditions?
What is the cancellation policy?

Inspecting the rendered HTML of the tabs component
We will have a look at the HTML of the tabs component, especially the CSS classes which is used to ease styling.
In the page, when viewed as published right-click and select Inspect in the dropdown menu of the browser.
The CSS classes used for the tabs component are:
cmp-tabs, cmp-tabs__tablist, cmp-tabs__tab, cmp-tabs__tabpanel and cmp-tabs__tabpanel--active.


2. Styling the Core Components:
Now that we know which CSS classes are available for styling, we will:

Style the tabs component to make the tab titles bold.
Style the carousel to hide the buttons below the slides.
Inspect the tabs and the carousel HTML and find out the public CSS classes that should be styled.

In CRXDE Lite open the custom client library style.less file.
/apps/ancestry/clientlibs/clientlib-site/less/style.less
Set the font of the tabs titles to bold by adding the following code to the style.less file:
.cmp-tabs__tab {
    font-weight: bold;
}
Hide the buttons below the slides of the carousel by adding the following code to the style.less file:
.cmp-carousel__action {
    display: none;
}
Save the file.
Refresh the page in your browser and notice the changes.

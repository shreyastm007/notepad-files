Issues on Ancestry-Corp websites:

1. Ancestry-Corp logo and Searchicon is breaking on both Prod-disp and Domain but it is working fine on Prod-publisher. 
   Sometimes it will be visible on disp and dom,but vanishes again.
2. 2023-filter option for CA PR page is actually a dynamic value and was checked on both dev and stage and it was working. 
   But currently 2023- filter option is not visible on Prod-disp and domain.But available on Prod-publisher.
3. The 2023-filter option does not filter all the 2023 news pages. The thing is 20 new news pages have been published in this year. 
   But when we select 2023-filter option only 5 pages are filtered both on Prod-disp and domain.



Observations on Logo/Image issue:

1.Actual Image link:/content/experience-fragments/ancestry-corp/us/en/site/header/master/_jcr_content/root/header/logo.coreimg.svg/1675365281232/ancestrycorp-logo.svg
2.Issue: On domain when the image is opened in new tab it is migrating to this link -> /content/experience-fragments/ancestry-corp/us/en/site/header/master/jcr%3acontent/root/header/logo.coreimg.svg/1675365281232.svg
So, when we open image on new tab it says image is not available.
3.Same thing is happening with the search logo also.


url:
1.If we select the required page and click on MOVE option, there will be an option called "page name after move" so under this we can modify the url and click next.
So the url will be changed.

publish later workflow:
1. The thing is, under the start time of workflow it takes 5hrs 30min before the IST we have initiated. So afternoon when we initiated the process at 12:15 pm , it showed us 6:45am.
So it is the server settings. So,it is counted as UTC+5:30.



Observations:
Issue: 20 new news pages were added onto the site and those new pages are visible on the site. But on selection of 2023 filter option only 5 news pages are visible.

1. Thing is, the 15 pages which we added recently are not visible when 2023 filter option is selected.
So, I checked the properties with the previous pages and Its fine.
SO, We can check on one thing, lets clear the cache for these two below links:
a)/content/dam/ancestry-corp/News-Content-Fragments
b)/content/ancestry-corp/en-us/newsroom/in-the-news.html


1. cms-aem-ancestry-corp -> ui.content -> content -> jcr_root -> content -> experience-fragments
